## Recreating Instagram page.

<p>This repository is part of the challenge presented by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/digitalinnovation-one/">Digital Innovation One</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielapinheiro129/">Gabriela Pinheiro.</a><p>

<p> The Instagram webpage was chosen to be recreated practcing CSS Flexbox. To put in other words, we have learned how to
wrap up content and filling it up with some boxes. Furthermore, we have learned also how to align contents, position and 
customization. In the figure below you can see how the "final" page look like:</p>

<p> Although it looks an easy job to be done, I have spent some hours racking my brains on it. However, it totally worthed it.
Thanks to the Digital Innovation One and our tutor, I am now able to apply the same technique in other projects. I cannot wait until then. </p>
